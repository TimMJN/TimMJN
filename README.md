# Introduction
 
Hi there. 

My name is Tim, and I'm a DIY electronics enthusiast. I design and build analog and digital synthesizer modules, and publish my designs here. My own modular is in the [Kosmo](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/modular) format, and I have made PCBs available for the majority of my modules. The schematics you find here are also fully compatible with the Eurorack format. If you have any questions about my designs, or wish to get some PCBs from me, please get in touch via GitHub or the [Look Mum No Computer forums](https://lookmumnocomputer.discourse.group/). I'll be happy to help!

# Modules
Here is an index of the synthesizer modules I have developed so far:

- [Arduino Sequencer](https://github.com/TimMJN/Arduino-Sequencer): extendable sequencer based on the Arduino Nano. Schematics and firmware are available, as well as PCBs/panels in a 8-step 2-voice configuration.
- [Arduino Clock Divider](https://github.com/TimMJN/Arduino-Clock-Divider): Arduino Nano-based clock divider with 8 adjustable division and rotate function. Schematics, firmware, and PCBs/panels are available.
- [Euclidean Rhythm Generator](https://github.com/TimMJN/Arduino-Euclidean-Rhythm-Generator): A 16-step 4-voice rhythm sequencer based on the Euclidean algorithm, powered by an Arduino Nano. Schematics, firmware, and PCBs/panels are available.
- [Voltage-Controlled Panner/Crossfader](https://github.com/TimMJN/Voltage-controlled-panner-crossfader): A dual voltage-controlled analog signal processor, which can act as a panner or a crossfader. Based on a single A3360 VCA chip. Schematics and PCBs/panels are available.
- [Morse Generator](https://github.com/TimMJN/Arduino-Morse-Gate-Generator): An Arduino-based module which converts text files on an SD card to Morse code. Can be used for subliminal messaging, as well as generating pseudo-random rhythms. Schematics and firmware are available.
- [Geiger Counter](https://github.com/TimMJN/Geiger-Counter-Module): Small mod circuit to convert a popular cheap Geiger counter to a usable synth module. Generates a decaying pulse every time an ionizing particle is detected by the tube. Only schematics are available.

# Other stuff
These aren't exactly synth modules, but other interesting/useful stuff:

- [Rail Splitter](https://github.com/TimMJN/Rail-Splitter): A virtual ground circuit for splitting a single-rail power supply into a dual-rail one. Useful for powering synth modules from a single-channel benchtop PSU, mainly to be used for prototyping. Only schematics are available.

# License
All designs here are released under GPL-3.0 licence. Feel free to use and adapt them to your heart's desire. The only ask to refrain from mass-production and commercialisation of the PCB designs presented here, as I rely on PCB sales for funding new module designs. If you use (parts of) my designs in your own modules, please credit me on your schematics and PCBs to help users find the original creator. I call upon your good conscience to make fair use of my work shared here.

# Support
If you like the resources I have made available here, and wish to support the development of new modules, feel free to buy me a few components through a small donation. I mainly design modules for fun, but you probably already know it can be a costly endeavour. All small contributions help me, thank you very much!
